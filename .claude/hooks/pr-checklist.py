"""PostToolUse hook: nudge the agent through project-workflow chores after a PR is opened.

Claude Code runs this after every `Bash` tool call (the matcher in
`.claude/settings.json` scopes it to Bash). When the command that just ran was a
pull-request-creating command (`gh pr create`), the hook emits a
`hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` block so the agent works through the
documentation / AGENTS.md / CLI / e2e-scenario checklist before stopping.

The checklist text lives in the sibling `pr-checklist.md` so it can be edited
without touching this script.

For any other command the hook stays silent (no stdout, exit 0), so it is a no-op
on the vast majority of Bash calls.

Hook contract: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks.md#posttooluse

# words; the trailing lookahead requires whitespace or end-of-string after
# `create` so it does not fire on `gh pr create-from-draft` and friends (`\b`
