// MARK: - CodexRolloutPostureReader

/// Reads a session's EFFECTIVE approvals posture from the latest
/// `turn_context` record of its rollout file (issue #717).
///
/// codex ≥ 0.146 persists `approvals_reviewer` (and `approval_policy`) into
/// every `turn_context` rollout record — turn contexts are written when a
/// turn spawns, from the same context that routes that turn's approvals, so
/// the latest record IS the per-session ground truth the #585 snapshot
/// design had to approximate. In particular it survives resumes (which fire
/// no SessionStart hook) and attributes mid-session "Approve for me"
/// toggles to the toggling session.
///
/// Reads are bounded: rollouts of multi-day threads — the exact sessions the
/// turn_context path exists for — reach tens of MB, so the reader scans a
/// fixed-size tail chunk first (turn contexts recur every turn, so the
/// latest is almost always near EOF) and falls back to scanning the whole
/// file only when a single turn appended more than the chunk after its
/// turn_context (large tool results).
///
/// Returns `nil` when the rollout carries no signal (missing file, no
/// `turn_context` records, or a pre-0.146 record without
/// `approvals_reviewer`) so the caller can fall back to the snapshot
/// heuristic. Any present-but-unrecognized value degrades toward `.user`
/// (notify-anyway), the same fail-safe direction as `CodexConfigReader`.
