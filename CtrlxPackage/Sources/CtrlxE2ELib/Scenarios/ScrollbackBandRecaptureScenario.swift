/// E2E scenario: a multi-row background band that has scrolled into *history*
/// loses its background on re-capture (#580 — the scrollback analogue of #578).
///
/// ## The bug
///
/// PR #579 fixed multi-row background bands in the **visible** area by capturing
/// it with `tmux capture-pane -e -N` (preserve trailing spaces) and carrying the
/// cross-line SGR state when rebuilding the rows. The **scrollback** capture was
/// intentionally left on plain `-e` and still reset the SGR state per line, so a
/// band that scrolled into history had the exact same root cause: tmux trims the
/// band's continuation-row spaces (they bear no setter of their own — the bg is
/// carried via tmux's cross-line SGR state) and the rebuild reset the state
/// between rows, so those rows rendered with the default (black) background.
///
/// ## The fix
///
/// Apply `-N` to the scrollback capture too and carry the SGR state across
/// scrollback rows, exactly as the visible area does. To keep static history
/// reflow-safe, `processCapturePaneForStreaming` trims the now-preserved
/// *default*-bg trailing spaces back off plain rows (a band's non-default-bg
/// spaces are kept). See `TmuxService.processCapturePaneForStreaming` and
/// `trimTrailingDefaultBackgroundSpaces`.
///
/// ## Reproduction
///
/// 1. Draw a 6-row full-width gray band (bg setter on the first row, the rest
///    carrying the bg via tmux's cross-line SGR state) as normal output lines.
///    Screenshot — the band is fully gray in the visible area (painted by the
///    live byte stream).
/// 2. Print a screenful-plus of filler so the band scrolls up into history
///    (above the visible fold). Park the cursor with a foreground process
///    (`cat >/dev/null`) so nothing redraws.
/// 3. Switch away to another pane and back — this disconnects and re-subscribes
///    the pane stream, forcing `processCapturePaneForStreaming` to rebuild the
///    scrollback from a fresh `capture-pane`.
/// 4. Scroll up to reveal the band in the rebuilt history and screenshot — with
///    the fix every band row is still gray; without it the band's continuation
///    rows render black.
