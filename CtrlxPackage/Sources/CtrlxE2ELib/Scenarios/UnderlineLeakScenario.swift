/// E2E scenario: Underline SGR attribute leak across line boundaries (#352)
///
/// Reproduces the bug reported in issue #352 where typing in a Claude Code
/// session causes spurious underlines to appear on text that should be plain.
///
/// ## The bug
///
/// `processCapturePaneForStreaming` ends with `extractActiveSGR(...)` being
/// emitted to put SwiftTerm into the same SGR state the real pane has at the
/// cursor. But the information needed to reconstruct that state is missing
/// from tmux's `capture-pane -p` output in one specific case:
///
/// 1. A row is filled edge-to-edge with underlined spaces (an `\e[4m` followed
///    by spaces to the row's right margin — a common pattern for drawing a
///    solid underlined separator).
/// 2. `capture-pane -p` trims the trailing underlined spaces as if they were
///    plain whitespace, keeping only the leading `\e[4m` on that row.
/// 3. If every row below it is empty (no content follows), tmux never emits a
///    corresponding `\e[0m` anywhere in the capture — there is no cell that
///    needs to transition out of underline.
/// 4. `extractActiveSGR` walks the captured lines, sees the `\e[4m`, and —
///    with no reset to match — returns `\e[4m` as the "active" state at the
///    cursor even though the real pane has reset SGR long before the cursor.
///
/// The capture output therefore ends with `\e[4m`, putting SwiftTerm in
/// underline mode. Every subsequent live-stream byte (typed characters,
/// Claude Code's UI redraws, etc.) inherits the underline until some
/// explicit reset reaches SwiftTerm — matching the user-reported symptoms.
///
/// ## Reproduction
///
/// 1. Draw a 80-column row of underlined spaces (with a trailing `\e[0m`)
///    at row 5.
/// 2. Park the cursor on row 7 column 0 and keep the foreground process
///    alive so the shell doesn't print a new prompt.
/// 3. Force a re-capture (switch away and back) to invoke
///    `processCapturePaneForStreaming` on this state.
/// 4. Type many screens' worth of characters via `send-keys`. The terminal
///    driver echoes each keystroke back through the live stream, so every
///    echoed character is rendered with SwiftTerm's post-re-capture SGR
///    state. If the fix holds, every character is plain. If the bug
///    regresses, every character is underlined — hundreds of underlines
///    light up across many rows, impossible to miss.
