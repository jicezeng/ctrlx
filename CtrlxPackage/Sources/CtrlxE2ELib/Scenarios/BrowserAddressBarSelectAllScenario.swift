/// E2E scenario: a real mouse click on the in-app browser's address bar
/// selects the whole URL and keeps it selected (issue #651).
///
/// **Issue:** #651. PR #641 added Safari-style select-all-on-focus for the
/// address bar via SwiftUI's `TextField` + `TextSelection`, but the selection
/// only held under keyboard or accessibility focus. On a real *mouse* click
/// AppKit's field editor set the caret from the click on mouse-up — after the
/// deferred selection — so the whole-URL selection flashed and was immediately
/// lost. `BrowserDownloadsAndErrorsScenario` focuses the bar with AX
/// (`macFocusElement`), which has no mouse tracking to override the selection,
/// so it never touched this path. This scenario drives a real `CGEvent` click
/// (`macCGClickElement`) instead — the path users actually hit.
///
/// **Scope — this is a positive end-to-end test, not a strict bug-gate.** The
/// original defect is a race between the deferred selection and the field
/// editor's mouse-up caret placement, and with this scenario's dead-port setup
/// it does *not* reproduce under the harness's synthesized click: with no page
/// loaded the main queue stays quiet during the ~50 ms between mouse-down and
/// mouse-up, so the deferred `Task` lands the selection *after* the caret and
/// the pre-fix build passes this same scenario (verified by running it against
/// the reverted `TextField` implementation). `BrowserAddressBarRefocusScenario`
/// is the strict bug-gate: with a *loaded* page, WebKit's main-thread activity
/// drains the main queue during the tracking loop and the race reproduces
/// under the harness (verified failing before the `pendingFocusSelectAll`
/// fix). This scenario's remaining value is proving the mouse-driven
/// select-all path works end to end against the error-page layout.
///
/// No page server is needed: the tab opens to a dead port, the navigation
/// fails, and the browser keeps the failed URL in the bar (Safari-like). The
/// URL field sits *above* the error overlay, so it stays clickable. Every
/// assertion is scoped to the field itself
/// (`.allOf([.anyTextMatches("URL"), …])`) so the copy of the failed URL that
/// the error page also renders can't mask the result.
///
/// Flow:
/// 1. Render an OSC 8 link to `http://127.0.0.1:9899/` (nothing listening) and
///    open it "In App" → error page, and the bar keeps the failed URL.
/// 2. A first real mouse click selects the whole URL; typing over it replaces
///    it, so the field no longer contains the dead-port token `9899`. Had the
///    click not kept the selection, the caret would sit past the text and the
///    keystrokes would append, leaving `9899` in the field.
/// 3. A second click (field already focused) positions the caret past the
///    short text instead of re-selecting, so the next keystrokes append and
///    `cleared` survives.
