/// E2E scenario: multi-row background band loses a line's background after
/// navigating away and back (#578).
///
/// Reproduces the bug reported in issue #578 where a Codex composer's
/// full-width gray background band renders correctly on first view but loses
/// the background on one or more of its lines after the session is navigated
/// away from and returned to. iTerm and the real terminal render the same pane
/// correctly, so the bug is specific to the app's mirror.
///
/// ## The bug
///
/// `tmux capture-pane -e` (without `-N`) trims trailing spaces at each line's
/// end. A *multi-row* background band is drawn with the bg setter on its first
/// row only — tmux's SGR state then carries the bg across line boundaries, so
/// the band's continuation rows are nothing but bg-colored spaces with no
/// setter of their own. Trimming erases those spaces, leaving the continuation
/// rows byte-identical to genuinely-blank rows. `processCapturePaneForStreaming`
/// then rebuilds each row independently with an SGR reset between rows, so the
/// continuation rows render with the default (black) background.
///
/// The first view renders correctly because the band is painted by the *live*
/// byte stream (the real escape sequences). Re-viewing the session rebuilds the
/// screen from `capture-pane`, which is where the background is lost.
///
/// ## The fix
///
/// Capture the visible area with `-N` (preserve trailing spaces without joining
/// wrapped lines) so the continuation rows keep their real bg spaces, and
/// restore the SGR state carried into each rebuilt row so those spaces inherit
/// the band's background. See `TmuxService.processCapturePaneForStreaming`.
///
/// ## Reproduction
///
/// 1. Draw a 6-row full-width gray band (bg setter on the first row, the rest
///    carrying the bg via tmux's cross-line SGR state) with text on alternating
///    rows — mimicking a composer's suggestion list.
/// 2. Park the cursor below it with a foreground process (`cat >/dev/null`) so
///    the shell doesn't print a fresh prompt and nothing redraws the band.
/// 3. Screenshot: the band is fully gray (painted by the live stream).
/// 4. Switch away to another pane and back — this disconnects and re-subscribes
///    the pane stream, forcing `processCapturePaneForStreaming` to rebuild the
///    screen from a fresh `capture-pane`.
/// 5. Screenshot: with the fix every band row is still gray; without it the
///    band's continuation rows (everything below the first) render black.
