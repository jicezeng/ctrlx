/// E2E scenario: reproduces the user-reported "click anywhere on the
/// terminal opens the file" bug.
///
/// **Setup:** emits a single OSC 8 `file://` sequence whose start is at the
/// top of the screen and whose close arrives only after the cursor has been
/// moved to the bottom-right. SwiftTerm's OSC 8 close handler iterates
/// every row between the open position and the cursor's current position
/// and marks each cell with the link's payload — even cells that never
/// received a visible glyph. This is the exact shape of Claude Code's TUI
/// behaviour: an OSC 8 link is opened, the TUI repositions the cursor
/// while drawing the rest of its frame, then the link is closed, and
/// every cell touched in between inherits the link.
///
/// The scenario then runs `clear`, which resets SwiftTerm's visible cells
/// to default but does NOT invalidate `cachedPayloads` — those entries
/// stay live because no character or attribute changed (default ➜
/// default). A subsequent click on a row that is now visually empty:
///
/// * On main, hits a cached OSC 8 payload via `urlAt`'s direct
///   per-cell check and opens `hello.txt`.
/// * On this branch, `urlAt` routes through `detectURLs`, which trims the
///   payload range to the trimmed line text. The cleared rows have empty
///   line text, so no `DetectedURL` is produced and the click falls
///   through harmlessly.
