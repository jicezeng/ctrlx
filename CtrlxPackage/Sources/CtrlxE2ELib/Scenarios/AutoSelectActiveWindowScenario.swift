/// E2E scenario: Fresh-launch auto-select lands on the tmux-active window (issue #653)
///
/// Reproduces the bug where opening the Mac app with an existing multi-window
/// session auto-selected the wrong window. Setup:
/// - A session with two windows where **window 1** is the tmux-active window.
/// - A Claude session starts in **window 0** (the *non-active* window), which is
///   the first agent session to appear and triggers the app's auto-select.
///
/// Before the fix, the auto-select picked the window that merely *contained* the
/// agent pane (window 0), so the app opened on window 0 even though tmux's active
/// window was window 1. After the fix it lands on window 1 — matching what a
/// sidebar click already did. The final assertion (window 1 selected) times out
/// against the buggy build and passes against the fixed one.
