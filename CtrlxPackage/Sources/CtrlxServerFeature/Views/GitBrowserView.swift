/// view and a single place to attach an accessibility identifier for E2E.

/// The ``GitWorkbenchStore`` is owned by ``MainView`` and cached per session, so
/// the git state (selected workspace view, file, diff) survives tab/session
/// switches — mirroring how `FileBrowserState` is retained. This view only
/// observes the store; it never creates it.
///
/// Right-click and double-click on a Changes-tab file row are surfaced through
/// GitWorkbench's `onChangesRightClick` / `onChangesDoubleClick` hooks (the
/// store's `repositoryURL` makes those callbacks hand back **absolute** URLs).
/// Right-click pops up the very same native menu as the File Explorer — built
/// by ``fileContextMenuItems(fullPath:directoryPath:isDirectory:settings:openSettings:onOpenFileInNewTab:onShowInFileExplorer:)``
/// — and double-click opens the file in its default app.
