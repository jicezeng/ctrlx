/// Optional relay-side minimum-client-version gate (issue #659).
///
/// The relay is normally a dumb E2EE router that never inspects versions — the
/// host and viewer negotiate compatibility peer-to-peer inside the encrypted
/// `peerHello`, which the relay cannot read. That handshake only force-upgrades
/// a client when its *peer* is new enough to tell it to; it can't rescue an
/// old-host + old-viewer pair, and it can't let the relay refuse a client
/// independently of its peer.
///
/// This gate closes that gap with a *server-visible* backstop: clients report
/// their marketing version in the WebSocket `clientVersion` query parameter
/// (part of the pre-E2EE upgrade request, readable by the relay), and the relay
/// independently refuses any client below `minVersion` — closing the socket with
/// a typed `CLIENT_TOO_OLD` error (`ErrorMessage.clientTooOld`).
///
/// `nil` from `fromEnvironment` means the gate is disabled, which is the default:
/// self-hosted relays leave `MIN_CLIENT_VERSION` unset and stay zero-config.
///
/// ## Known limitation
/// The relay can only enforce against clients new enough to *report* their
/// version. Builds predating the `clientVersion` field send nothing, and
/// `rejectUnknown` picks the policy for them:
/// - `false` (default) — let unknown-version clients through, so enabling the
///   gate doesn't break the entire pre-reporting fleet at once. Clean enforcement
///   then becomes available for the *next* wire break onward.
/// - `true` — refuse unknown-version clients too. Only safe once a
///   version-reporting build is universal.
///
/// Thrown at boot when `MIN_CLIENT_VERSION` is set but not a clean dot-separated
/// numeric version — fail-loud rather than silently running a gate that logs as
/// "enabled" while accepting almost every client (see the note on `fromEnvironment`).
