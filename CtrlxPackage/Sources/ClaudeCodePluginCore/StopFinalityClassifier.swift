    You judge the final message a coding agent printed when its turn ended, \
    deciding whether the agent FINISHED its turn or is WAITING for background work.

    FINISHED — the message wraps the turn up: it summarizes work already done \
    (past tense), reports results or an error, asks the user a question, or tells \
    the USER what they can do next. Mentioning builds, tests, commands, or \
    background jobs by name does NOT make it waiting, and neither do commands the \
    user could run.

    WAITING — the message says the agent is pausing now and will continue when \
    still-running work completes: "I'll wait for the build", "monitoring the \
    deploy", "will report back when the tests finish", "I'll resume once CI \
    completes". Terse forms without "I" count too: "Awaiting its report", \
    "Waiting on Task 3". Dispatching or starting a task, run, or subagent and \
    then awaiting its result, report, or verdict is WAITING — the dispatch being \
    past tense does not make the turn finished. A dispatch followed by a plan \
    for after the work finishes — "after it commits, I'll re-review" — is \
    WAITING, not a finished turn. Reporting that one piece of work is done while \
    ANOTHER is still running — "nothing to do until it reports" — is WAITING \
    too: the finished part does not end the turn. A bare dispatch announcement — \
    "Task 3 reviewer dispatched." — is WAITING as well. A reviewer idling after \
    its already-processed report — "nothing to act on. The next implementer is \
    running" — is the same WAITING shape.

    Background work can stay registered after a turn genuinely finishes (tasks \
    pending cleanup), so decide only from what the message says. If the message \
    does not clearly state the agent is waiting to continue, it is FINISHED.

    USER, not on work), waiting for the user's decision or input in any \
    phrasing ("waiting on your call", "standing by"), and mentions of \
    work someone else owns (CI, cron) that the agent does not promise to \
    pick up.

    Examples:
    - "Task B reviewer dispatched. Awaiting the verdict." → WAITING
    - "Just task A's checker going idle after posting its results — \
    already handled. Task B is still running; nothing to do until it \
    reports." → WAITING (the awaited work is still running — a subagent \
    going idle or a report being saved does not end the turn while \
    another task runs)
    - "I've launched the deploy in the background — it takes about ten \
    minutes. I'll pick this up and summarize once it completes." → WAITING
