# Sidecar Plugin Auto-Update — Design

**Date:** 2026-07-25
**Status:** Approved

## Problem

URL-installed sidecar plugins never update. `PluginUpdateChecker` and the full
download/verify/install pipeline exist (`gallager plugin update [--apply]`), but
nothing triggers a check automatically, there is no UI, applying an update does
not reload the running sidecar (`PluginRegistry.enable` early-returns for active
plugins), and bridge files installed into agents' config locations (e.g.
`~/.pi/agent/extensions/gallager.ts`) are never refreshed — so an "updated"
plugin keeps running old code everywhere.

## Goals

- Per-plugin preference: check for updates automatically (default **on**), plus
  a manual "Check Now" button.
- Automatic checks when a new Gallager version is first launched (plugin
  releases usually accompany app releases), with a daily fallback.
- Updates install automatically into the Gallager plugin location and refresh
  the bridge in every agent location the user previously installed to.
- Inform the user a new version landed and that Gallager and/or agent sessions
  need restarting.

## Non-goals

- Updating bundled (`claude-code`, `codex`) or folder-dropped (dev-installed)
  plugins — they have no `manifestURL`.
- Auto-installing updates whose bundle host changed (`sourceChanged`) — those
  keep requiring the manual trust flow.
- Installing bridges into locations the user never opted into.
- Tracking whether agent sessions actually restarted.

## Architecture

### PluginUpdateManager (new)

`CtrlxPackage/Sources/CtrlxServerFeature/Distribution/PluginUpdateManager.swift`
— `@MainActor @Observable`, created by `AppCoordinator` at boot, exposed to
SwiftUI via `@Environment`. Injected at init:

- `PluginRegistry` and `GallagerPaths`
- the existing `URLSessionProtocol` seam (streaming download stub for tests)
- `PreferencesService` (persists `lastRunAppVersion`, `lastPluginUpdateCheck`)
- `hasActiveSessions(pluginID:) -> Bool` closure from `AppCoordinator`
- the notification client (`TerminalNotificationService` pattern)
- a clock (for the daily timer; `TestClock` in tests)

Observable state: `checking: Bool`, `lastCheckDate: Date?`, per-plugin inline
result (up-to-date / updated / error), `manualReviewUpdates: [PluginUpdate]`
(source-changed), `restartNotices: [RestartNotice]` (in-memory; see UI).

### Registry model changes

Two fields on `PluginRegistryEntry`, both `decodeIfPresent` so existing
`registry.json` files load unchanged:

- `autoUpdate: Bool` — default `true`. The per-plugin toggle. Host-side
  concern, so it lives in the registry next to `source`/`enabled`, not in the
  plugin's `settings.json` (which is pushed to the sidecar).
- `needsBridgeRefresh: Bool` — default `false`. Set when an update commits but
  the sidecar could not be hot-swapped; consumed on the next `enable`.

The boot-time registry rewrite in `AppCoordinator` must preserve both fields
(same rule as `.url` source preservation).

### Triggers

Automatic checks cover entries with `source == .url`, non-nil `manifestURL`,
and `autoUpdate == true`:

1. **App-version change:** at launch, compare
   `VersionCompatibility.currentAppVersion` to the stored `lastRunAppVersion`.
   Different or absent → check now, then store the current version.
2. **Daily:** at launch if `lastPluginUpdateCheck` is >24h old, plus a
   24h repeating task while running (Gallager is long-lived; launch-only
   checks would starve).
3. **Manual:** per-plugin "Check Now" button — checks that single plugin
   regardless of its `autoUpdate` toggle, and applies a found update the same
   way (the button press is the consent; there is no separate
   "update available — Install" state except for source-changed updates).

### Check → apply

1. `PluginUpdateChecker.check(entries)` → `[PluginUpdate]` (existing, tested;
   best-effort, silently skips fetch errors).
2. `sourceChanged == false` → `PluginInstaller.install(manifestURL:,
   trustConfirmed: true)` — the existing pipeline unchanged: HTTPS-only
   manifest fetch, streaming SHA-256 verify, zip-slip/tree validation, atomic
   commit, registry rewrite.
3. `sourceChanged == true` → never auto-installed. Recorded in
   `manualReviewUpdates` and surfaced in the UI with a button into the
   existing `AddPluginSheet` trust flow.

### Post-install

Ordering matters: the bridge template ships inside the bundle, so the
`install` RPC must be served by the **new** sidecar — the old process would
write the old template.

1. **Hot-restart if idle:** if `hasActiveSessions(pluginID)` is false →
   explicit `disable(id)` then `enable(id)`. (Explicit disable-first avoids
   the known `enable` early-return no-op for active plugins.) If busy → skip
   the swap, set `needsBridgeRefresh = true`.
2. **Bridge refresh (only after a successful swap):** for each location in
   `[default] + additionalConfigFolders`, call `install_status`; wherever it
   reports `.installed`, call the `install` RPC. Only refreshes locations the
   user opted into. No version comparison — refresh is unconditional where
   installed, which also sidesteps the known trap of `install_status`
   reporting the sidecar's version constant instead of the on-disk bridge
   version.
3. **Deferred refresh:** the manager sweeps entries with
   `needsBridgeRefresh == true` after boot-time plugin enabling completes
   (by then the app has restarted, so each flagged plugin's running sidecar is
   the new one), runs the same refresh, and clears the flag. Bridges can never
   be left stale.
4. Record a `RestartNotice` and fire one macOS notification per update batch.

## UI

### Per-plugin "Updates" section (`PluginAgentForm` in `AgentsSettingsView.swift`)

Shown only for URL-installed plugins; bundled and folder-dropped plugins show
no section (no dead toggles).

- Toggle **"Check for updates automatically"** → `autoUpdate` on the registry
  entry.
- Button **"Check Now"** with busy spinner; caption "Last checked: <relative
  date>"; inline result — "Up to date", "Updated to 0.2.2 — restart your pi
  sessions", or a red error (existing sibling-`Text` error pattern).
- Source-changed row: orange inline "Update 0.3.0 available from a new source —
  Review…" opening `AddPluginSheet`.

### Restart banner

Persistent orange `Section` banner at the top of the Agents settings pane
(same style as the existing agent-unavailable banner), one line per notice:

- Hot-swap succeeded → "pi updated to 0.2.0 — restart your pi sessions"
- Hot-swap skipped → "pi updated to 0.2.0 — restart Gallager and your pi
  sessions"

Banner state is in-memory on the manager: restarting the app is itself the
remedy for the Gallager half, and agent-session restarts can't be tracked, so
the notice clears on app restart. No settings-tab badge in v1.

### Notification

One macOS notification per batch via the existing Dependencies-injected
notification client: "Plugin updates installed: pi 0.2.0 — restart Gallager
and any pi sessions."

## Failure handling

- **Check failures:** automatic checks stay silent (existing checker
  behavior); the manual button surfaces the error inline.
- **Install failures:** atomic commit guarantees the old version keeps
  running. Log, show inline error, retry naturally at the next trigger — no
  retry loop.
- **Concurrency:** one in-flight check/apply at a time, guarded on the
  manager; a manual check during the daily check awaits it.
- **Downgrades:** `PluginUpdateChecker.isNewer` already rejects equal/older
  versions.

## Testing

- **Unit (`PluginUpdateManagerTests`):** version-change trigger, daily
  threshold, `autoUpdate` filtering, idle vs busy hot-restart,
  `needsBridgeRefresh` persistence + consumption on next enable,
  source-changed exclusion, concurrency guard. Uses the `URLSessionProtocol`
  stub, `PreferencesService.inMemory()`, and `TestClock` under
  `withMainSerialExecutor`.
- **Registry round-trip:** old `registry.json` without the new fields loads
  with defaults; fields survive the boot-time rewrite.
- **E2E:** echo-plugin-based scenario serving a bumped manifest locally;
  manual "Check Now"; verify banner + inline "Updated to…" status. Detailed in
  the implementation plan.

## Decisions log

- Trigger: version-change + daily fallback (user-approved).
- `autoUpdate` default **on** for URL-installed plugins (user-approved).
- Reload policy: **hot-restart if idle**, else restart notice (user-approved).
- Bridge scope: refresh **only where currently installed** (user-approved).
- Restart notice: **notification + persistent banner** (user-approved).
- Orchestration: new `PluginUpdateManager`, not AppCoordinator growth, not
  sidecar self-update (user-approved).
